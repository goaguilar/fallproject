# To be or not to be

## ~~That is the question~~ These are the questions

4.1. 1000

4.2. The algorithm checks each individual character in the dna to
the corresponding index of the target, adding one to the score if the
character at that index matches the one in the dna. After going through
all the characters in the dna, the score is divided by the length of the target.
The closer this is to one, the better the fitness is.

4.3. 1/18 or 0.055555

4.4. Count the minimum number of operations required to transform dna into the target
The closest it is to 0, the better the fitness is of the dna.

4.5. script.py mutates some of the characters in dna so the algorithm doesn't
get stuck in case there is not a character at a specific index from the parent generation.
